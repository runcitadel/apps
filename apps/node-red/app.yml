  tagline: Wire together the Internet of Things
  description: >-
    Node-RED is a visual programming tool for wiring together hardware devices,
    APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.


    It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click.  A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.


    The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others. An online flow library allows you to share your best flows with the world.


    Warning: Node-RED on Citadel is able to connect directly to Bitcoin Core, LND and Electrum, due to this you should be careful when installing third-party Node-RED nodes.
